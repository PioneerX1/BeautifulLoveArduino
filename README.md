# BeautifulLoveArduino
Arduino project that plays the jazz song - Beautiful Love, uses 2 arrays to store note frequencies in hertz and note durations in milliseconds

This project requires some hardware, including:

- Arduino microprocessor
- Piezo speaker or buzzer
- Some jumper wires
- Recommended:

A potentiometer (variable resistor) - this adjusts volume (or tone if you hook up a capacitor)
If not, atleast a 1000k resistor will do to lower the volume
